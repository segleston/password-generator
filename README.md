# password-generator



This password generator project was to showcase my javascript skills. 

Usage:

- User enters numeric value between 8 and 124 to advise how long th√üey want their password to be. 
- If conditions are met, user is then asked if they want numeric/upper case/lower case/special characters in their password (user must choose at least one)
- Password is then generated.
